## 1. Metahome, or Metaverse with Bioproducts of traditional Korean Medicine and Korean Cultural Contents

The place that realizes your dreams with one click, this is the very definition of Metahome. For this purpose, Metahome pursues a metaverse space where everyday life is the best embodied, and it aims at developing an online service where one can get an easy access to from anywhere in the world. Metahome’s first mission is to complete an online platform that delivers first-rate bioproducts of traditional Korean medicine with minimum distribution steps, and to achieve a model in which sellers and consumers grow together sharing the value of the Dongbogam, or the brand standing for quality bioproducts of traditional Korean medicine. Metahome’s vision is to grow to a company that leads a global trend, and after accomplishing the first mission, Metahome continues to expand it to a global platform where one can enjoy mobile/pc games, webnovels, and webtoons too. 

Metahome is an enterprise that introduces traditional Korean medicine and Korean culture to the world. Metahome has an online platform that is made of a metaverse space dealing with an internet shopping mall of traditional Korean medicine and other contents including games, webnovels, and webtoons. It also runs offline stores for users’ convenience. Metahome’s mining policy is to pay META coins to referral marketers for free, and users can enjoy Metahome service with these META coins.

Metaverse can be defined in many perspectives, but Metahome’s metaverse is a space where dreams come true. Metaverse is an imaginary space made of two-dimensional or three-dimensional world. It is a system that expands real lives to digitalized imaginary world. According to intentions of creating metaverse spaces and development of technologies, metaverse has advanced from a two-dimensional game to three-dimensional Virtual Reality(VR), Augmented Reality(AR), Mixed Reality(MR), and/or an Expanded Reality(XR). The advantage of metaverse is to enable users to enjoy various services beyond the limit of time and space. However, there is a disadvantage of metaverse: Users can be exposed to various problems because of an illusion of reality such as video game addiction symptoms. Metahome is designed to make good use of advantages of metaverse and to minimize its disadvantages.

What Metahome concentrates on is the bioproducts of traditional Korean medicine and the structure of its distributions. Products of traditional Korean medicine have been suspected as “unscientific.” In addition, despite their excellent qualities, many great products have not been able to overcome the limit of small businesses, and have been disregarded by consumers. Metahome notices the future value of such products of traditional Korean medicines that consumers have enjoyed less attention. 
One of the reasons that the traditional Korean medicine industry did not fully developed in the past was the prejudice that they were unscientific products. People often criticized that traditional Korean medicine had extant agricultural pesticides which harm livers and kidneys. In reality, however, every traditional Korean medicine treated by doctors of traditional Korean medicine is material that goes through GAP(Good Agricultural Practices) and/or GMP(Good Manufacturing Practice) tests, which means that it has passed the national verification and reached a global standard. Moreover, in Korea, China, and Japan, effects of their traditional medicine have been surveyed and reported in many books for more than 3,000 years, and it is pointless to regard traditional Korean medicine as something unscientific.

In fact, the main reason that causes stagnation in the sale of traditional Korean medicine is the distribution process. Currently products of traditional Korean medicine are mainly sold either through home shopping companies or through traditional markets.

When it is dealt in a home shopping company, most of the products are sold through an arrangement between a famous doctor of traditional Korean medicine and a company that produces products of traditional Korean medicine, and a considerable amount of money from consumers goes to the doctor and the home shopping company. In contrast, when it is dealt in a traditional market, the origin of a product is not clear, and it is often the case that a consumer turns his/her face away from this product.

In addition, it becomes clear toward what direction traditional Korean medicine and products related to this field should advance when we see the situations in China and Japan, where their traditional medicine dominates their markets. In China, traditional Chinese medicine has been developed under the support of the Chinese Communist Party since the early twentieth century. Currently, it adopts a system of having a hospital where a department for doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and a department for doctors of western medicine coexist. Having prepared this kind of system, they have been able to promote cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine, which also results in investment in large scales on various attempts. In Japan, doctors of western medicine have substituted doctors of traditional Japanese medicine since the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Thereupon, Japanese doctors of western medicine have studied traditional Japanese medicine and have developed a system that permits a mixed prescription of western medicine and traditional Japanese medicine. In this way, it is generally regarded that traditional Japanese medicine is playing a successful role as alternative medicine. Similarly, in Korea, recent bioproducts of traditional Korean medicine are produced in various items and some of them have won great successes. One of the main problems in the field of traditional Korean medicine is that such efforts have been aiming at the domestic market only, which indicates that there is a huge uncultivated market for traditional Korean medicine and bioproducts of this field. Huge Chinese investments to traditional Chinese medicine are targeting the global market, and it is also natural for bioproducts of traditional Korean medicine step forward to the global market. 

In conclusion, we understand that the future of products of traditional Korean medicine depends on changes of selling process and development of oversea markets. Dongbogam and Metahome have been created in solutions to such problems.
