## 1. Metahome, or Metaverse with Bioproducts of traditional Korean Medicine and Korean Cultural Contents

### 1.1 Definition of Metahome Service

“The place that realizes your dreams with one click”: this statement is the exact definition of Metahome. Accordingly, Metahome pursues a metaverse space where everyday life is best embodied. It aims at developing an online service that provides easy access to individuals worldwide. Metahome’s first mission is to complete an online platform that delivers first-rate bioproducts of traditional Korean medicine with minimum distribution steps and achieve a model in which sellers and consumers grow together sharing the value of Dongbogam. Dongbogam is the brand that symbolizes quality bioproducts of traditional Korean medicine. Metahome’s vision is to grow a company that leads a global trend. After accomplishing the first mission, Metahome continues to expand it to a global platform where one can enjoy mobile/pc games, webnovels, webtoons, and OTT (Over The Top) service. 

### 1.2 Outline of Metahome Project

One of the current global trends is to enjoy Korean culture. From BTS to Squid Game, Korean culture is consumed in various genres in global markets. The Metahome team understands that this moment is the right time that people are dire in need of a global platform that provides Korean cultural content in various genres. Accordingly, the team concluded that the most successful model of the platform should be a metaverse space where Korean cultural content is consolidated. This is how Metahome was created. 

Metahome concentrates on two fields that have been neglected by many people and three that have already been enjoyed by the public. The first two fields are traditional Korean medicine and Korean OTT service that can attract global attention. The latter three fields are mobile/PC games, webnovels, and webtoons that are already popular worldwide. In brief, Metahome is a metaverse space in which people can enjoy all these five services everywhere in the world.

Metahome has an online platform made of a metaverse space dealing with an online shopping mall of traditional Korean medicine and other content. It also runs offline stores for users’ convenience. Metahome’s mining policy is to pay Metacoins (hereafter METAs) to users depending on their participation. For example, METAs are airdropped to referral marketers who introduce new users and existing users who provide useful suggestions to the Metahome community. Users can enjoy Metahome service with these METAs. METAs can also be exchanged for Metahome’s HDBTC coins (hereafter HDBTCs) for value storage.

### 1.3 Metaverse and Metahome

A metaverse can be defined from many perspectives, but Metahome’s metaverse is a space where dreams come true. A metaverse is an imaginary space made of a two- (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) world. It is a system that expands real lives to a digitalized imaginary world. According to the intentions of creating metaverse spaces and technology development, metaverse has advanced from a 2D game to 3D virtual reality (VR), augmented reality, mixed reality, and expanded reality. The advantage of a metaverse is that it enables users to enjoy various services beyond the limit of time and space. However, it has a disadvantage, that is, users can be exposed to various problems, such as video game addiction symptoms, because of an illusion of reality. Metahome is designed to utilize the advantages of a metaverse while minimizing its disadvantages.


### 1.4 Importance of Traditional Korean Medicine

Traditional Korean medicine bioproducts and their distribution structure are the focus of Metahome. Traditional Korean medicine products have been suspected as “unscientific.” In addition, despite their excellent qualities, many great products failed to overcome the limitations of small businesses and have been disregarded by consumers. Metahome recognizes the future value of such products of traditional Korean medicines that consumers have provided less attention to. 

One of the reasons that the traditional Korean medicine industry did not fully develop in the past was the prejudice that they were unscientific products. People often criticized that traditional Korean medicine had extant agricultural pesticides that harm the liver and kidneys. However, every traditional Korean medicine prescribed by traditional Korean medicine doctors undergoes Good Agricultural Practices and Good Manufacturing Practice tests. Therefore, it has passed the national verification and met a global standard. Moreover, in Korea, China, and Japan, the effects of their traditional medicine have been surveyed and reported in many books for more than 3,000 years. Thus, regarding traditional Korean medicine as unscientific is unreasonable.

The main reason that causes stagnation in the sale of traditional Korean medicine is the distribution process. Currently, traditional Korean medicine products are mainly sold through home shopping companies and traditional markets.

In a home shopping company, most of the products are sold through an arrangement between a famous doctor of traditional Korean medicine and a manufacturing company. A considerable amount of money from consumers goes to the doctor and the home shopping company. In contrast, in a traditional market, the origin of a product is unclear, and a consumer often refuses this product.

In addition, when we observe the situations in China and Japan, where their traditional medicine dominates their markets, traditional Korean medicine and other related products have a clear direction. In China, traditional Chinese medicine has been developed under the support of the Chinese Communist Party since the early 20th century. It currently adopts a system that includes a hospital where separate departments for traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine doctors coexist. Through this system, they have promoted cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, resulting in large-scale investments in this area. In Japan, Western medicine doctors have substituted traditional Japanese medicine doctors since the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Thereupon, Japanese doctors of Western medicine have studied traditional Japanese medicine and developed a system that permits a mixed prescription of Western medicine and traditional Japanese medicine. As a result, traditional Japanese medicine has been a successful alternative medicine. Similarly, in Korea, recent bioproducts of traditional Korean medicine are produced in various items, and some of them have won great success. One of the main problems in the field of traditional Korean medicine is that such efforts have been aimed at the domestic market only. This situation indicates a huge uncultivated market for traditional Korean medicine and bioproducts exists in this field. Huge Chinese investments in traditional Chinese medicine are targeting the global market. Thus, advancing to the global market is also a logical move for bioproducts of traditional Korean medicine. 

In conclusion, the future of traditional Korean medicine products depends on changes in the selling process and the development of overseas markets. Dongbogam and Metahome have been created to solve such problems.




## 2. About Dongbogam

### 2.1 What is Dongbogam?

Dongbogam is rooted in Dongui Bogam 東醫寶鑑, one of the classics of traditional Korean medicine, which means “a noble medicine of the East.” To become a leading brand in the traditional Korean medicine industry, Dongbogam aims to support the research and development of products and contributes to the opening of stores and online markets. Its goal is to make traditional Korean medicine one of the key industries in South Korea. In cooperation with many organizations, including 14 government organizations and five universities, Dongbogam has constantly grown and launched new products. 

### 2.2 Road to Metahome

Dongbogam, a brand for traditional Korean medicine, is the center of Metahome. We have employed other selling methods for the Dongbogam products and have determined an online service made of a metaverse as the best method to utilize. This service operates an online shopping mall that provides consumers with a VR experience of traditional Korean medicine. This is how Metahome was created.

We planned Metahome in 2021, and as the first step of opening the Metahome service, we created 210 billion METAs (mainly for transactions) and 2.1 billion HDBTCs (suitable for value storage). Metahome launches various services to enable users to lead healthy lifestyles and enjoy proper rewards for their economic emancipation as follows.




## 3. About Metahome

### 3.1 Outline of Metahome Service

Metahome will offer an online shopping mall using metaverse technologies to allow users to purchase quality bioproducts of traditional Korean medicine easily and securely. It will also offer a platform in which users can enjoy other Korean cultural content, such as mobile/PC games, webnovels, webtoons, and OTT services. The operation policies of Metahome aim at the joint growth of producers (sellers) and consumers, which will be enabled by METAs and HDBTCs as explained in the next chapter.

### 3.2. Dongbogam Brand Policies

Metahome centers on an online shopping mall based on Dongbogam Grades. Dongbogam Grades are given according to users’ grades and comments, which will be rewarded with METAs. Similar to the Michelin Guides, Dongbogam Grades also adopt a system that reflects expert advisors’ opinions to secure the objectivity of the grades. Each year, we collect users’ and expert advisors’ opinions and confirm the Dongbogam Grades. 

A “Dongbogam One Star” grade is given to products graded 80 points or higher on a scale of 100 by consumers. A “Dongbogam Two Stars” is selected from “Dongbogam One Star” products. If a “Dongbogam One Star” product has an average score of 80 points or higher from expert advisors, then it can be graded with “Dongbogam Two Stars.” Finally, if a “Dongbogam Two Stars” product maintains its grade for 3 years, then it is graded “Dongbogam Three Stars.” 

### 3.3 Features of the Dongbogam Brand Policies

Our standard of Dongbogam Grades can satisfy consumers and producers, enabling users to select quality products easily. After establishing our policies of the Dongbogam Grades, Metahome will deal with other goods in addition to traditional Korean medicine bioproducts. Most search engines of current online shopping malls, particularly in South Korea, are designed to meet providers’ needs. People have been particularly suspicious about the product evaluations of these shopping malls. Producers and shopping malls are likely to be engaged in consumer evaluations. However, they have not suggested any solutions to this damaged public confidence. In contrast, Dongbogam Grades are rated after securing a condition that producers and shopping malls are excluded. Moreover, Metahome trains expert advisors who can evaluate products objectively. Through this cooperation with expert advisors, Metahome creates an environment with a broad scope for evaluation, including evaluating elements that consumers cannot recognize. By doing this, the reliability of the Dongbogam Grades is promoted. We expect that such detailed policies of the Dongbogam Grades will bring revolutionary changes in online shopping.

### 3.4 Metahome Service Related to the Dongbogam Shopping Mall

Applying metaverse technologies, Metahome operates a platform for mobile/PC games, through which users can obtain Dongbogam products for free. It also efficiently provides useful information about traditional Korean medicine and other related products.

First, Metahome provides information in 2D and 3D animation films about the procedures for producing Korean herbs and traditional Korean medicine. Thus, users can understand traditional Korean medicine and its bioproducts. With this service, we expect that users can purchase products easily. Metahome also provides users opportunities to purchase Dongbogam products for free when they win mobile/PC games. We aim to create two mobile games in the near future: “Finding Herbs” and “Raising Chickens.” If the user wins in “Finding Herbs,” he/she will be given the herbs that he/she found in the game. When the user reaches a certain score in “Raising Chickens,” he/she will have organic eggs delivered to his/her home. 

### 3.5 Features of Dongbogam Games

Compared with the games of Metahome, a Vietnamese mobile game stands in the opposite direction, that is, a play-to-earn game on a type of NFT coin. To begin this game, one should initially buy three NFT coins, which are used to select characters. A distinct feature of this game is that one can create his/her characters after synthesizing two different characters. This feature entices users to pay more to achieve rare characters, which can be sold at a high price. Thus, users are stimulated to win a rare character. This game can be maintained only if new users sign in or existing users continue to pay for characters. This feature shows the limit of a typical NFT-coin-based game. As a result, the game gained popularity globally only at the beginning and is recently being enjoyed by a few users only. 

On the contrary, Metahome’s games give real rewards: herbs and limited Dongbogam products. This feature indicates a completely different design from the previous NFT-coin-based game. Rewards include precious items, such as wild ginseng that is more than 100 years old, various organic products, and limited Dongbogam products. Because Metahome’s games reward with such real herbs and products, we expect that Metahome will be welcomed as a model that links a metaverse space with everyday life.

### 3.6 Extended Version of Metahome and Evolution of the Dongbogam Brand

Now, people all over the world love BTS’s music and enjoy Korean movies and dramas, including Parasite, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Squid Game on Netflix. Influenced by these works the number of people gaining interest in Korean culture is increasing. They are curious about Koreans’ everyday life. What kind of food do they eat? What health beverages do they drink? What clothing styles do they wear? What do they do in their leisure time, and what do they watch and read for fun?

When the first step of Metahome project is completed, the Metahome team will deal with not only traditional Korean medicine bioproducts but also all items of everyday life. The Dongbogam brand policies will be applied, thus providing solutions to the questions above. Simultaneously, Metahome aims to expand its service to diverse fields, including mobile/PC games in various genres, webnovels, webtoons, and OTT services in association with Hwagook (花國), a company that develops online content. Thus, Metahome aims to develop a metaverse space where anyone from anywhere can enjoy Korean content.

### 3.7 Metahome’s Game Platform

Metahome and Hwagook will primarily develop mobile games in various genres based on experiences of operating the two above-mentioned games. Metahome also plans to build a platform where users can enjoy mobile games using their PCs and vice versa, thus providing them various options to play games. Furthermore, it will promote an Internet community where users can exchange opinions and information. By participating in community activities, users can get METAs airdropped. Moreover, in cooperation with a community of other content users, they are expected to develop the Metahome ecosystem into a more creative direction. As the Metahome shopping mall and Dongbogam brand expand, items for reward can be diversified, which is expected to increase the motivation for participating in Metahome games.

### 3.8 Metahome’s Webnovel and Webtoon Platform

Metahome and Hwagook will expand the platform for webnovels and webtoons of all genres to promote a writer-friendly environment. Webnovels and webtoon platforms pay writers based on the number of views. Regarding Metahome’s platform, it will pay writers in two ways: (1) basic pay and (2) basic pay plus extra pay based on the number of views. Writers who receive the basic pay work in an environment where the business cycle is stable and predictable. To earn the extra pay, they create additional interesting works that can enrich the contents of Metahome’s platform. Moreover, Hwagook will educate writers to specialize in different works. For instance, Hwagook will train story, information, continuity, and storyboard writers. Thus, Hwagook creates an environment where writers in such varied roles work together sharing creative thoughts. 

After opening a domestic platform for webnovels and webtoons, Metahome and Hwagook will turn it into a global platform in a year. A few Korean platforms of webnovels and webtoons are currently dominant worldwide. However, they face the challenge of a significantly long interval between a Korean original work and a translated work. This situation reduces communication opportunities between Korean writers and foreign readers. 

In association with Hwagook, Metahome’s platform will prepare a system that airdrops METAs as a reward for translation, through which Korean works can be translated within a few days. Thus, Metahome finally creates a global platform of webnovels and webtoon, where writers and readers communicate freely. This aspect is one of the distinct features of webnovels and webtoons. As a result, Metahome will have an opportunity to reorganize the current markets of webnovels and webtoons.

### 3.9 Metahome’s OTT Platform

When Metahome’s platform for Korean content becomes globalized, Metahome will include OTT service as well to diversify its contents. The majority of current Korean OTT companies cannot provide their services to global markets because they do not understand the nature and potential power of Korean cultural content. Korean cultural content can be a genre, but none of the companies have conducted a business dealing with Korean content only. Based on the know-how of operating the global platform of webnovels and webtoons, Metahome will pioneer a global OTT service that deals with Korean movies and dramas. In the beginning, Metahome’s OTT service will be composed of popular Korean dramas and movies along with outstanding but not well-known works. Then, Metahome will create its Korean dramas and movies to expand its list just as Netflix does.

In particular, we are confident that our directors working creatively with the production crew from Hwagook will turn original webnovel and webtoon works that have gained global recognition by the Metahome platform into the most entertaining Korean dramas and movies. Experiences of operating the Metahome global platform of webnovels and webtoons and audience responses will be shared with those producers. Thus, we expect that they can produce outstanding works because they comprehensively understand how to make the work fun and stirring from the beginning of the production. Similar to the policy of airdropping METAs to users in making webtoons and webnovels, Metahome users can participate in producing Metahome Korean dramas and movies directly or indirectly. Then, METAs will be airdropped according to the degree of their participation.

### 3.10 Vitalization of the Metahome Comminity

As mentioned above, when Metahome users provide ideas or suggestions for making Metahome online content, METAs will be airdropped to vitalize the Metahome community. We expect that various opinions suggested by this advanced community can help to create virtuous circulation from webnovels to webtoons, from webtoons to dramas/movies, and from dramas/movies to games and vice versa. This scenario will lead to the development of Korean cultural content in various genres.




## 4. Merits of META and HDBTC

### 4.1 Merits of META and HDBTC

METAs and HDBTCs have different methods of issuing tokens compared with other coins. They have three merits: METAs adopt mining as referral marketing to minimize waste of resources; METAs and HDBTCs take the Ethereum Request for Comments 20 (ERC-20) token system to strengthen the convenience of transactions; Finally, METAs and HDBTCs grow together with the Dongbogam brand, and we name it “brand-value sharing token (BST).”

### 4.2 Mining of METAs and Swapping for HDBTCs

The mining method of METAs is performed through referral marketing, which eliminates the waste of resources. When a person signed up with Metahome, he/she will be given METAs. If he/she brings a person to join as a member of Metahome, then he/she is given additional METAs as well as the new member. Users can purchase products and evaluate them using these METAs. As previously explained, products with 80 points or higher on a scale of 100 are given the Dongbogam Grades, and users who participate in evaluations will be given METAs as well.

The mining method of METAs should be noted. Many other coins are mined through a meaningless process that only wastes electricity. In contrast, in Metahome, one can earn coins by joining as a member or by introducing a new member to the Metahome ecosystem and by doing productive activities in the Metahome ecosystem. Thus, Metahome recognizes the act of bringing another member and the creative activities in the ecosystem as an achievement that one can attain after making efforts and gives METAs as rewards.

Currently, when a coin platform company is successful in its business, it takes all the profits. In the future, this situation may continue or worsen. On the contrary, Metahome is designed to allow users to enjoy all of the above-mentioned advantages easily and efficiently through a metaverse. We name a coin that has such a particular mechanism as BST, which will be explained later in this chapter.

### 4.3 Features of META and HDBTC

Compared with Bitcoin, METAs and HDBTCs are more suitable for transactions. Bitcoin has been proven durable (goods are not easily corrupted), portable (goods can be moved easily), replaceable (can be exchanged with other coins according to their values), verifiable (the authenticity of goods can be verified immediately), divisible (distinguishability of dividing goods easily), and scarce (can be easily acquired or created with no surplus) as an ideal means of holding value. 

Nevertheless, Bitcoin verification is time-consuming to be suitable for transactions. In contrast, HDBTCs are ERC-20-based tokens and thus can make real-time transactions between individuals, companies, and countries.

ERC-20 is a proposal identifier, and the ERC-20 token has emerged as the technical standard issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain and is a leading global chain industry. Developers can use Ethereum to develop new types of applications. HDBTC and META will use the ERC-20 to issue its cryptocurrency and build its ecosystem to create new value

### 4.4 Outline of BST Coins

Metahome’s HDBTCs differ from the algorithmic stablecoins or NFT tokens in that the latter is based on imaginary concepts, whereas the former is based on a real scenario or an activity of an economic entity.

As mentioned above, HDBTCs are designed to become BST. It adopts a system in which all users, including producers and consumers, grow together sharing the value of the Dongbogam brand. HDBTCs are the crucial element of Metahome and it has the following features as a BST coin.

It raises its brand value by participating in Metahome’s activities or providing and purchasing Dongbogam products. Such an effect will also lead to the vitalization of Metahome online content, including mobile/PC games, webnovels, webtoons, and OTT services. As a result, Metahome users will continue to increase, thus raising the brand value of Dongbogam. Additionally, various types of online content can be prepared. Completing a virtuous circle, such a flow will enhance user satisfaction as well. 

### 4.5 Merits of BST Coin: Shared Growth of Metahome and Its Users

The conspicuous feature of Metahome’s ecosystem is that it adopts a structure in which users can grow together. Its detailed structure can be described as follows. The structure of Metahome’s ecosystem is related to users’ degree of participation. Specifically, users can not only consume Metahome’s products and online content but also participate in growing or producing the products and online content, which will complete the outstanding structure of Metahome’s ecosystem. Therefore, in Metahome’s ecosystem, users can participate in growing, producing, and rating organic groceries and bioproducts of traditional Korean medicine and in creating and translating mobile/PC games, webnovels, webtoons, and OTT works. Consequently, the more activities users participate in Metahome, the better achievement they have.

HDBTCs will be listed this year. Subsequently, one can use them and METAs within Metahome ecosystem to purchase Dongbogam products and use other content, including games, webnovels, webtoons, and OTT works. When the Metahome’s ecosystem is completed, we expect that HDBTCs will play a crucial role in it by functioning as a BST coin. Within the structure of Metahome’s ecosystem, we expect that HDBTCs will satisfy all the users.
